# phior

## Overview

---

phior is a small collection of functions that are useful to me in my day to day development:

- `clr()` is a short alias to clearing the global environment
- `cls()` clears the console if interactive
- `get_desktop()` returns the system desktop directory if findable
- `get_home()` returns the system home directory
- `setwd_to_file()` sets the working directory to the directory the script is saved in


## Installation

You can install the development version of phior from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Phioria/phior")
```
